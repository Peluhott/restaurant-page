Going to create a webpage for restaurant Pelu-Pasta that focuses on pasta foods
going to create it entirely using dom Manipulation to practice.


** ending project early

I understand how the dom manipulation works and not goign to use this on my porfolio, and i have limited time because of school and work so I have to move on

** things left to do**
create food and about section
add functions that change the class assigned to the content div based on the button pressed

** things i need to do in the future
 use rem, fr , % to make site more responsive
 use tools to determine font, font size, color scheme,
 maybe try to use figma to design layout
 practice webpack more
 next time use server instead of having to bundle each time.
 make sure not to use vh for width
 use variables in css
 give meaningful labels to variables
